        <span>B</span>ioWare was founded by Ray Muzyka and Greg Zeschuk, alongside Trent Oster,
        his brother Brent, Zeschuk's cousin Marcel, and Augustine Yip. Of the founding
        team, Muzyka, Zeschuk and Yip had recently graduated from medical school at the
        University of Alberta, and had a background in programming for use in school.
        Together with Yip, they had created a medical simulation programme. The three 
        also played video games for recreation, eventually deciding to develop their 
        own. Their success in the medical field provided them with the funding they 
        needed to launch a video game company. To make their first game, they pooled 
        their resources, which resulted in capital of $100,000.

        <br>
        <span>T</span>he company was incorporated on 1 February 1995, though formally launched on 
        22 May 1995. Their first game, Shattered Steel, began its life as a proof-of-concept 
        demo, similar to the MechWarrior games. This demo was submitted to ten publishers, 
        seven of whom returned to the company with an offer. A publishing deal for Shattered 
        Steel was eventually signed with Interplay Entertainment. Brent Oster and Trent Oster 
        left BioWare at that time to form Pyrotek Studios, which continued developing 
        Shattered Steel but broke up a year later, with Trent returning to BioWare to 
        finish the game. BioWare's first game was released the following year. 
        Shattered Steel's release was described by IGN as a "modest success" with 
        "decent sales". Two noteworthy points were the deformable terrain (player weapon 
        damage caused craters in the environment) and zone damage (well-aimed gunfire 
        could shoot mounted weapons off enemies). A sequel to Shattered Steel was planned 
        for 1998 but never realized.

        <span>B</span>ioWare's founders and staff were keenly interested in both computerized and 
        pen-and-paper variants of role-playing games. Their next development project, 
        therefore, was determined to be a role-playing game. When Interplay financed 
        "exploratory development", BioWare presented the publishers with a demo called 
        Battleground: Infinity. Interplay suggested that the demonstrated gameplay engine
        would be well-suited to the Dungeons & Dragons licence which it had acquired 
        from Strategic Simulations. Accordingly, Infinity was reworked in line with the 
        Dungeons & Dragons ruleset. The result was Baldur's Gate, with a development 
        cycle of three years. During this time, the three doctors continued to practice 
        medicine. The demands of development later prompted Muzyka and Zeschuck to leave 
        medicine and move into full-time development. Augustine Yip decided to continue 
        with his medical practice. Baldur's Gate sold more than two million copies after 
        its release, nearly matching the sales of Diablo. Following the success of 
        Baldur's Gate, the Infinity Engine was used for the games Planescape: Torment 
        and the Icewind Dale series. The success of Baldur's Gate was followed by an 
        expansion pack for the game: Tales of the Sword Coast.
